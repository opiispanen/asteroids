# Asteroids
I was inspired by The Coding Train's [Coding Challenge #46.1: Asteroids with p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacZU523FyM) video and started coding while as I was watching it. There were a lot of things I wanted to do differently so I did.

## The end result
The end result consists of a reusable classes like the Game class that controls the rendering, events and objects. Also the whole game instance is wrapped in a Promise so different actions may occure depending on the result in the game. Also added a simple UI, ship health and death animations, effects etc.
